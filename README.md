# Content Import Example

This is an application showcasing how you can implement Importing Content and Files into a knowledge base using [Integration.app](https://integration.app). The app is built with Next.js/React.

[Demo](https://content-import-example.vercel.app/)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Integration.app workspace credentials (Workspace Key and Secret). [Get credentials](https://console.integration.app/settings/workspace) from the workspace settings.
- MongoDB connection string (We provide a docker-compose file to spin up a local MongoDB instance. See [Using mongodb via Docker](#using-mongodb-via-docker) for more details.)
- AWS credentials (for S3)

## Setup

### 1. **Clone repository & Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 2. **Set up environment variables file:**

```bash
# Copy the sample environment file
cp .env-sample .env
```

### 3. **Add your credentials to the `.env` file:**

> Note: The following credentials are optional but enable additional features:

- **AWS S3**: Enables file download and storage in S3
- **Unstructured.io**: Enables text extraction from PDFs, Word documents, and other file formats

### 4. **Add the Scenario to Your Workspace:**

This application relies on predefined [flows](https://console.integration.app/docs/building/blocks/flows), [actions](https://console.integration.app/docs/building/blocks/actions), and other primitives, all organized within a **Scenario template**

To use the same flows and actions in your workspace, navigate to the [Continuously Import Content to My App Scenario](https://integration.app/scenarios/continuously-import-content-to-my-app) and click the **"Add to App"** button. This will add the required flows and actions, data sources and other primitives to your workspace.

### 5. Configure your apps

The [Continuously Import Content to My App Scenario](https://integration.app/scenarios/continuously-import-content-to-my-app) adds **8 apps** to your workspace and for most apps to work, you'll need to provide configuration parameters. The configuration guide for each apps explains how to get the credentials needed. See video below for an overview of the configuration process:

### 6. **Start the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Using mongodb via Docker

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine

### Setting up MongoDB

If you want to use MongoDB via Docker, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

You can now use the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable to connect to the database:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://admin:password123@localhost:27017/knowledge
```
